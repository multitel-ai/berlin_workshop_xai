# Design Sprint Methodology

## Overview

Design Sprint methodology, from Jake Knapp (Google), <https://www.thesprintbook.com/>

Planning
- Before: Prepare: get ready the workshop
- Day 1 (09-05): Scope: scope the problem and map the service/product, (do some user interview?)
- Day 2 (09-06): Empathize & Map: discover the user needs (some project at Multitel -> interview),
- Day 3 (09-07): Empathize & Map
- Day 4 (09-09): Ideate: benchmarking and sketching,
- Day 5 (09-10): Deciding: define the solution to test and storyboarding,
- Day 6 (09-12): Prototyping: prototype the solution and prepare the tests,
- Day 7 (09-13): Prototyping
- Day 8 (09-14): Testing: test the solution with targeted users,
- Day 9 (09-15): Take away: analyze results and write the final report.

Seven Rules of Brainstorming (IDEO)
1. Defer judgment 
2. Encourage wild ideas
3. Build on the ideas of others
4. Stay focused on the topic
5. One conversation at a time
6. Be visual
7. Go for quantity

## Day 1: Scope

### Ice Breaker

Ice breaker with participants: Ask participants who they (short introduction) and what they expect from the workshop and how they feel (mood board).

### Definition of long term goal

What are the long term goals behind this project.

Questions to start:
- Why do we choose this project ?
- Where do we want to be in 6-12 months ?
- What's the long term goal ?

The long term goal must reflect principles and aspirations of the team.

### List the questions which have to be answered during the sprint

Starting from the long term goal, try to make a list of the important questions. These questions direct decisions and solutions during the whole sprint. Moreover, last day evaluation will partly answer to these questions.

Questions to start:
- What questions do we want to answer during the sprint?
- If we are to achieve our long-term goal, what must be true?
- Let's look to the future: our project has failed. What is the likely cause of this failure?
An other way to proceed is to start from assumptions and known obstacle and reformulate them as questions.

Use a Note-and-Vote to gather Sprint Questions from the team. We’ve adjusted the steps to help you run the process online:
- Note: Everyone writes down their ideas individually on a piece of paper.
- Self-Edit: Each person reviews their own list and picks one or two favorites.
- Share: One at a time, each person creates a Miro sticky note for their idea and places it on the board.
- Vote: Give each person two votes in Miro. Everyone chooses their favorite idea and places their votes.
- Decide: The Decider makes the final decision based on the votes (or not). If you’re not sure, you can wait and choose your Sprint Questions after you complete the map.

This list can be refined/extended during days 2-3 (until the definition of the goal of the sprint).

### Cartography/roadmap of the problem

The goal is to draw a roadmap to guide the work of the sprint by cartographying the problem. It must be as simple as possible.

Sketch a first version of it now. It will be updated during days 2-3.

Procedure
1. Before you start: Agree on 3 important elements before starting the mapping process:
	1. Who is the Target Client / User?
    2. Beginning of the story: when does the target customer experience begin?
    3. End of the story: what is the goal we are trying to reach?
2. Map alone, together (Create a space in your board for each participant to work. Then, facilitate the process of creating a single map with the team.)
3. Everyone sticks their timelines on the wall
4. Tell your story
5. Highlight
6. Clean up and laugh
7. One big story

How to proceed to draw a roadmap:
1. List the important actors on the left
2. Note the end of the story on the right
3. Between the two, put texts and arrows
4. Favor simplicity
5. Get help from the participants (is it ok for you?, etc.)

### Define topics and distribute them among participants (for days 2-3)

Prepare a first list. See below for the details.

## Days 2-4: Empathize & Map

Goal: discover the user needs and choose a target

Planning:
- day 2 and day 3 AM: presentations and interviews (when a group is ready or an interviewee is there, everybody come back to listen and take notes)
- day 3 PM: merging HMW notes and updated roadmap, and define short term goal

### HMW note taking technique
HMW = How might we...

The technique:
- When you hear something interesting, transform it into a question
- Put it on a HMW sticky note
- Keep them for day 3 PM

### Expert presentations

Expert presentations and interviews (what expertises are needed?, ):
1. decide on some topics it would be interesting to have some insight,
2. in pairs, gather some information on the selected topics (from literature but not only)
3. each group present a synthesis on its topics (others ask questions and take "how might we..." notes)
4. update the goal, questions and roadmap if needed.

### Users' interviews

Discover user needs by interviewing end users (every participant ask questions and take "how might we..." notes).

Member of the teams who have a real experience with transformers can share it to others.

Design a small interview guide in the perspective of days 2-3 interviews (on using/training experiences with transformers, can be persons whi plan to … (but it must be concrete, concrete needs are required))

Interview guide:
1. Introduction
  - Welcome and thanks
  - Introduce the sprint
2. Main
  - Show the goal, questions and roadmap to have his reactions
  - Experience with transformers
    - model(s)?
    - domain(s)?
    - data modalities?
    - what kind of use (simple use, train, design, etc.)?
    - encountered problems and how he solves them?
    - what he would have liked to have/know before?
    - need for explanations?
3. Conclusion
  - Last questions/remarks
  - Thank for participation
  - Available for test?

At the end, update the goal, questions and roadmap if needed.

## Day 5: Fix the target

### Decide the target of the sprint

Goal: definition of short term goal(s), i.e., the target(s) of the sprint (by merging roadmap and HMW notes, and analysing the result)

Procedure:
1. Gather all the HMW notes on the same frame
2. Regroup notes into common themes and name these themes
3. Vote for the most interesting/important questions
4. Take the most popular notes and put them on the corresponding steps of the roadmap
5. Decide on the user and the note to address during the sprint
6. Based on the target note and user, choose the question(s) to answer during the sprint

Homework (if needed): Prepare flash presentation (the goal is to explore existing tools & methods in search of interesting ideas for our solution)

## Day 6: Ideate & Deciding or Design Studio

### Flash prensetation

Goal: benchmarking

Each participant make quick presentations (3') of tools & methods that he finds interesting
- For each presentation, prepare a note for each presentation with the main idea and a quick sketch

### Ideate & Decide

Goal: Solution design (the goal is to generate a lot of candidates by combining multiple generating activities)

Procedure:
1. Design brief: remind goal and other important elements of the sprint
2. Solution research: each participant reviews gathered data up to now and thinks of potential idea of solutions
3. Ideation: crazy-eight
4. solution design, iteration 1: each participant design a more detailled solution based on generated idea
5. presentation & critique, iteration 1: each participant present his solution (3') and others critique it (2')
6. solution design, iteration 2: each participant improves his solution based on others' critiques
7. presentation & critique, iteration 2: same as iteration 1
8. vote: for part of solutions first, then for whole solutions
9. final decision

### Storyboarding

Goal: get a detailled solution and a potential use scenario

Procedure:
1. Draw cases as steps of the storyboard
2. Define the opening step (i.e., start of the use scenario)
3. Fill others cases of the storyboard

Keep in mind that the complete scenario must allow a test of max 15'

## Days 7-8: Prototyping

Goal: prototype the solution and prepare the tests

Tasks & Activities:
- Design and implement the prototype (the goal is to have something that **seems** functional, to be able to conduct tests, need to identify best tools to use)
- Prepare testing sessions (design test protocol and dry-run)

Maybe 2 tracks are possible here:
- implement a non-fonctionnal but complete prototype for the tests
- explore technical possibilities and constraints to implement a functionnal one

**TODO list tools that can be used at this point**

## Day 9: Testing & Take away

### Testing

Goal: test the solution with targeted users (participants of Berlin's workshop, they must be contacted before)

Tasks & Activities:
- Conduct user tests ! (1 hour per session, all the participants observe the tests but not in the same room !)
- Gather data and learn !

### Take away

Goal: analyze results and write the final report

Tasks & Activities:
- Analyze results
- Discuss future works and valorization of the results (publications, etc.)
- Write the final report
- Make the final presentation
- Retrospective on the course of the sprint (get feedback and improve the methodology)
